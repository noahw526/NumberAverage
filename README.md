## Setup
Windows Installation: ```Command Prompt> java -jar "D:\CS 232\Lab2A\dist\Lab2A.jar```
## Usage
This starter program for most new java code users is a great example for using some of the functions inside within the code. Seeing as the user of a program like this will most likely be a beginner, it allows them to use some of the more basic features within java.
## How To
After lauched within the command prompt, the user will be asked to input 10 integers between 1 and 100. After the tenth integer, the program will print out the largest and the smallest along with the average of all of the numbers entered. 
## Inside The Code
#### Use of "for loops" and "if" statements to find the largest and smallest number.
* This is an example of how the scanner tool "gets" the users input for the numbers guesses.
